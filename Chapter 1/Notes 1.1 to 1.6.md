* Computer programs are composed of primitive operations
* Examples of primitive operations:
  * Put a red dot onto this screen position
  * Send the letter A to the printer
  * Add up two numbers
  * etc.
* Programs contain a huge number of operations
* Anatomy of a computer
  * CPU
    * The central proccesing unit handles all the operations and contains transistors.
    * Memory
      * Volatile
        * RAM or random access memory is a form of memory that is volatile. Volatile memory goes away when the power is pulled. It is also faster and contains instructions for the cpu.
      * Non volatile
        * Hard Drive
        * SSD
      * Removable storage
        * Cd drive
        * floppy drive
        * USB 2.0/3.0
    * Networking
      * Computers are sometimes connected to networks through phone lines or fiber optics
    * HID
      * HID’s are human interface devices
      * they are connected through ports
      * they help a user interact with the CPU, Ram and other components of a pc
    * Data and programs are stored in primary storage and secondary storage
    * The cpu reads machine instructions from memory. The instructions direct it to communicate memory, secondary storage, and peripheral devices
  * Random Fact 1.1
    * The ENIAC (electronic numerical integrator and computer) was the first usable electronic computer
    * Invented at Upenn
    * ran on vacuum tubes
  * Translating human readable programs into machine code
  * Java programs run in a JVM
  * JVM’s virtualize ideal cpus for portability.
  * Machine instructions are encoded so they can be stored in memory
  * Because machine instructions are encoded as numbers it is difficult to write programs in machine code
  * High-level languages allow you to describe tasks at a higher conceptual level than machine code
  * A compiler translates programs written in a high level language to machine code
  * Java Programming Language
    * Designed for portability
    * Secure
  * Eclipse is an ide:
    * Integrated development environment
    * Prevents you from interacting with shell
    * GUI displays file structure
    * You must save your work
    * Back up your code!
    * Compiling: hit run, or in unix use “javac program.java && java program.java”
  * Comments help readers understand your program
  * Method is called by specifying an object, method name, and parameters.
  * A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks
  * A syntax error is a violation of the rules of the programming language. Compilers detect syntax errors
  * Logical error causes a program to take an action that a programmer did not intend.
  * Common errors include misspelling words
* In class notes:
  * Prerequisites
    * Computer saavy (file management, text editing)
    * Problem solving skills
    * Time management
    * High school math
    * No prior programming required
  * What do computers do?
    * Organizing and writing term papers
    * Help balance checkbook
    * Keep track of grades
    * They are good game machines
  * How do computers do it?
    * Computers must be programmed to perform tasks. Different task require different programs.
    * A computer program executes a sequence of very basic operations in a very fast amount of time.
  * What is a computer?
    * CPU
    * Memory
    * Peripherals
    * Executes instructions
    * Executes instructions rapidly
    * General purpose device

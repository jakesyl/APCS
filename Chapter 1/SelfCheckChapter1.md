R1.2: A computer is different from a household appliance in that a household appliance does only one thing, whereas a computer can be programmed to do a variety of things.



R1.3 The various parts of a computer can be ranked by certain paramaters such as Speed, Cost, and Storage capacity. A CPU has the best speed, the highest cost and the lowest storage capacity. RAM has the second highest cost, the second highest cost and the second highest storage capacity. ROM such as a hard drive has the lowest speed, the lowest cost, and the highest storage capacity.

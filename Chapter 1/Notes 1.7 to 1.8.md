Chapters 1.7 to 1.8 Notes



* Chapter 1.7 Errors
 * Syntax Errors
   * Syntax errors are a violation of the rules of a programming language
   * Syntax errors are compile time errors.
 * Logic Errors/Run time errors
   * A logic error causes a program to take an action that the programmer did not intend. You must test your programs to find logic errors.
 * Self Check:
   * Suppose you omit the // characters from the HelloPrinter.java program but not the raminder of the coment. Will you get a compile-time error or a run-time error.?
     * You will get a compile time error
   * How you can find logic errors in a program?
     * Expecting an output based on an input and running the program with that given output
* Chapter 1.8 The Compilation Process
 * An editor is a program for entering and modifying text such as a Java Program.
 * The Java compiler translates source code into class files that contain instructions from the Java virtual machine.
 * Source Code- statements you write are in class files.
 * System and Println Stream classes have implemented all necessary actions and placed the required class into a library.
* Self Check:
 * What do you expect to see when you load a class file into your text editor?
   * You can expect to see source code.
 * Why canâ€™t you test a program for run-time errors when it has compiler errors?
   * You can only test a program for run time errors if it is executed.

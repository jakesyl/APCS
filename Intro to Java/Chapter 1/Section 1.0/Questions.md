1.2:  There are several reasons for which we use the Binary system. Firstly computers that use the Binary system are less expensive and more reliable than those that don’t. Them being more reliable is because of the simplicity of the system 1 is on, 0 is off. It is impossible to have anything except for 1 and 0 because there is nothing between on and off. With the exception of quantum computing which is far too expensive to be practical. It’s also small, a base 2 takes up far less space than a base 10.

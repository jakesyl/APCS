 * Hardware
   * Physical components
   * key components:
     * CPU
     * I/O
     * Main Memory/RAM
       * Holds software while it is being processed by the cpu
     * Secondary Memory/HDD’s
       * Long term storage
 * Types of storage, and management of information
   * Analog
     * Continuous, for example thermometer
   * Digital
     * Breaks information into pieces and shows them as numbers
     * Benefits:
       * Enhances ability to send info over a long wire
 * Software
   * Programs/Applications
     * A set of instructions for the computer to follow
     * Software: Programs and data
   * Examples

     * Binary System has two digits
       * One digit is called a bit
       * This system is called base 2
 * Key Concepts:
   * A computer system has both hardware and software
   * Execution of program:
     * Program is copied from secondary memory to main memory
     * CPU executes program until it ends, The binary system is 2^n

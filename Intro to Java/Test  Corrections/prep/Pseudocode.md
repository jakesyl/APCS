1. initialize Scanner, Random Generator

prompt

prompt response = answer

for ( define a counter, counter less than or equal to answer, increment the counter)

[

var = random gen

if (0)heads [increment heads]

if (1) tails [increment tails ]  ]

print The coin flipped to tails + tails + times resulting in + (tails/answer.00) + % times being tails and + heads+ times being heads and +(heads/answer.00)+% times being zero




2.



intalize random generator/random var/counter

do (

random generate

print number + “ “

counter ++

)while(number!=0)

print Length is + counter



3.

initialize counter =1, counter2=0;

while counter<100

[

print counter \t

counter++

counter2++

if counter2==5

print a blank line

counter 2 = 0

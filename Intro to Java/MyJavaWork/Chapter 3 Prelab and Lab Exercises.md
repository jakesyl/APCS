Chapter 3 Prelab Excercises:



1. Two would be the first number printed, every number after it would be 1 higher than it would have been had it not been switched.
 1. Output: Had to add together 4 even numbers to reach value 16. Sum is   Table :



sum

TRACE nextVAl

count

12

20

10

5

 b.while (sum<-1)   {   ... normal code  {

while (count<5)

}  }



1. //main statements and stuff here then loop  int count=0  while (count<=100)

{  System.out.println(“I love computer science!!”);

count += 1

}  //this loop is loop counted controlled

4. end of code, delete system.out...... and replace with:   System.out.println(“The sum of your integers is ” + sum + “ and the number of integers read are ” + keepGoing );

5. Count should be count=count -1

(Count >=1)

So the final code should look like

count = 10;

while (count>=1)

{

System.out.println (count)l

count = count -1

}

2.Even though there is an indentation, the else clause is associated with the preceeding if rather than the first if. The program will produce the correct output if it is rewritten as:

{

if (total < sum)

System.out.println (“total == MAX and is < sum.”);

}

else

System.out.println (“total is not equal to MAX”);

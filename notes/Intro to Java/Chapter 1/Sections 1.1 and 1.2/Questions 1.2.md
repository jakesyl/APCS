Short Answer:

1.4:  Random Access Memory (RAM), is primary memory. This means that it is used to store things while the CPU is processing them, and while they are about to be processed by the CPU. ROM, is not primary memory, and is also not volatile. RAM is volatile because as soon as the computer loses power the RAM is deleted. Another reason RAM is different then ROM is that RAM is rewritable, it can be and is written over thousands of times. Rom however is not, ROM can be written once, and afterwards cannot be written over.



1.5:  A Local Area Network (LAN) is a connection between a few computers in a room, or a building, a LAN is different from a WAN in that a WAN can connect many computers, and now one wan, the internet connects billions. A LAN also requires computers to be close to each other. A wan however, can move information across the world. A Wan is also multiple Lans connected.



1.6:  The formula for a point to point network is n(n - 1) / 2=t n being number of computers, to being total number of connections needed. For eight computers you would need 36 communication lines. For 9 computers you would need 45 communication lines. For 10 computers you would need 55 communication lines.

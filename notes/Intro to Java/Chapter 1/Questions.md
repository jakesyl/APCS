Short Answer



1.7.  The first example of a java comment is // which means that the comment will continue until the line is over. This is different from /* in that /* must be closed. /* comment also spans multiple lines.



1.8.  None of these identifiers are in preferred case style. Additionally q is meaningless, although technically correct it is not good practice. For the same reason c. or theNextValueInTheList is not good either, while it does show description it is too wordy. For totVal is not clear enough and someone who is trying to understand the code might not understand the name, as was said before, names should be descriptive.
